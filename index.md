Sarama is compatible with Go 1.2 and 1.3.

A word of warning: the API is not 100% stable yet. It won't change much (in particular the low-level Broker and Request/Response objects could *probably* be considered frozen) but there may be the occasional parameter added or function renamed. As far as semantic versioning is concerned, we haven't quite hit 1.0.0 yet. It is absolutely stable enough to use, just expect that you might have to tweak things when you update to a newer version.
