Sarama provides a "2 releases + 2 months" compatibility guarantee: we support
the two latest releases of Kafka and Go, and we provide a two month grace
period for older releases. This means we currently officially support Go 1.3
and 1.4, and Kafka 0.8.1 and 0.8.2.

Sarama follows semantic versioning and provides API stability via the gopkg.in
service. You can import a version with a guaranteed stable API via [`import
"gopkg.in/Shopify/sarama.v1"`](http://gopkg.in/Shopify/sarama.v1).
